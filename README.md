This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
Setup env variables in a new `.env.local` file on your root server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## The task
- this is a project in the context of STARTHACK 2025. We picked the Syngenta case: find solutions for farmers in India to take better decisions. A first step is to build an analytics tool. Secondary will be a simple AI model, e.g. a classification model based on the crop and date and location.
